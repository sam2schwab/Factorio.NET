C# wrapper for the Factorio Lua prototype definitions data

This project is a WIP, as of now only recipes are fully parsed

## Features

- Downloads, reads and parses lua data from the base mod of the game (data.raw)
- Supports old versions down to 0.5.0 (as long as they are here: https://github.com/wube/factorio-data/releases)

## Usage

This project was created to build a C# tool similar to the factoratio tool available on https://factorio.rotol.me/
